# CSV File Parser

Build a script to parse CSV files, extract data, and display it in a structured format. Allow users to upload CSV files for processing.

## Notes

I lost time trying to make it complicated from the beginning. This was a huge mistake because it took me around 10 minutes, time I
could have used to finish the "display" part. The `display.php` simply prints a table with the header and values. However, as I
mentioned, I lost time trying to establish the relationship between the headers and values, which, while not a bad idea, was
unnecessary for the project's simplicity. In the end, I discarded the complicated code and implemented the simplest solution
possible.

**Things to keep in mind:**

* Quickly create a simple structure.
* Avoid overcomplicating things at the beginning.
* Start coding without initially focusing on validation; add validations later.
* Always opt for simplicity.
* Don't overthink.
